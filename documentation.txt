# Financial Analysis Chatbot

## Overview
This is a simple prototype chatbot that provides financial insights based on the analyzed 10-K reports of Microsoft, Tesla, and Apple.

## Functionality
- The chatbot answers predefined financial queries related to total revenue, net income changes, total assets, total liabilities, and operating cash flow.
- It extracts the latest available data and compares net income changes year over year.
- The chatbot works by matching user queries to predefined responses.

## How to Use
1. Run the chatbot script (`chatbot.py`).
2. Enter one of the predefined queries:
   - "What is the total revenue?"
   - "How has net income changed over the last year?"
   - "What is the total assets value?"
   - "What is the total liabilities value?"
   - "What is the cash flow from operating activities?"
3. The chatbot will return the requested financial information.

## Limitations
- The chatbot only responds to predefined queries and does not understand free-form questions.
- It relies on the latest available financial data from the CSV file.
- More advanced AI and NLP techniques would be needed for a fully functional financial assistant.

## Test Results
The chatbot was tested with various queries. The results are saved in `test_results.txt`.
